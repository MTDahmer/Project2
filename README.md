# Project2

add a config.py file with the following data 

consumer_key = "Your Consumer Key"  
consumer_secret = "your Consumer Secret"  
access_token = "Your Access Token"  
access_token_secret = "Your Access Token Secret"  

Run either load_db.py or streaming_API.py.  I'm still working on it, some glitches...but they will get you data to start coding.   
I first started with load_db.py and it quickly loaded over 3900 tweets in my db. Then I had API limitations. Just ran it again
successfully and it added records, but not that many.  I initially ran it with line 42 uncommented and then I changed it to add the 
for loop. Thus, I have mostly data for Bill Weld locally.

The second script (had new database names) runs fine...but errors out and I need to keep re-running. It adds rows more slowly.

Just wanted to put what I have so far out here for you to run and set up your local environments.
