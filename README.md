# Indecision 2020

This app attempts to look at the current 2020 presidential candidates presence on twitter  
in terms of followers, retweets and 'liked' tweets (favorites). We also look at certain  
(pre-defined) terms to see how often the candidates are mentioning them in their tweets.  

We utilized the Twitter API with the python tweepy wrapper to get our data from each  
candidate's twitter account. We use MongoDB, Flask and javascript (nvd3) to build a dashboard  
plotting our findings. The app has been uploaded to Heroku and can be accessed at the  
above link.
