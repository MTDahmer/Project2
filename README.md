# Project2

add a config.py file with the following data 

consumer_key = "Your Consumer Key"  
consumer_secret = "your Consumer Secret"  
access_token = "Your Access Token"  
access_token_secret = "Your Access Token Secret"  

Run load_db.py.  I'm still working on it, runs much better...but they will get you data to start coding.
